# Assignment 1: Website Review - Telus.com - Alex Tran
The website I chose to review is [Telus.com](https://www.telus.com/en/). My evaluation is based on **4 categories**:

1. Usability and User Experience
2. Accessibility
3. Mobile Friendliness
4. Content Design

## 1. Usability and User Experience
### Successes
- There is less text content displayed, which makes the site easy to read and scan for key terms. The site includes *read more* buttons after text content if users are interested in learning more.
- The navigation bar menu items have short and relevant naming conventions, which allows user to easily read and identify when trying to navigate through the site. 
- Each call-to-action button is large and unique that it grabs the users attention. Some example are *"Get Started"* and *"View This Deal"*.
- The hover feature is unique as it either enlarges icons or changes colour for certain tabs/buttons on the site. This tells users where their cursor is on a site and makes them want to click on certain tabs/buttons.
- The site features different language options, such as English, Punjabi and Chinese. This is a great tool for users that read in a different language. Also there is a 24/7 online technical support service to assist users and clients.
- The search bar input field has auto complete/suggestion when users first start typing. This is useful for users who prefer to search items as opposed to spending time navigating through the site to find the information they need. 

### Failures
- While browsing through some of the nested drop-down menus from the main navigation bar, a destination path would appear. This felt unnecessary for me as I only selected a few tabs. It also made the top portion of the screen feel cluttered and redundant as the same text would be displayed twice.

## 2. Accessibility
### Successes
- Lighthouse accessibility test scored **92%** for both desktop and mobile devices.
- The site displays majority of their content on a white background with purple, green and black (branded colours) text to contrast.

### Failures
- 1 image doesn't have a *alt attribute*. This will make it challenging for individuals that are visually impaired to understand what's being displayed on the site.

## 3. Mobile Friendliness
### Successes
- Mobile displays the exact same content as viewing from a web browser, with the exception of the navigation bar being replaced with the hamburger menu. This allows users who are familiar with the site to have the same web browsing experience on their phones. It also eliminate the time spent learning new features.
- Mobile prompts the download app feature on top of the viewport. Although it is in a location that is difficult to reach within your thumb zone, the text box is not that large to impair visibility and usability of the site. As stated by [Jenny Gove](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/principles/?hl=en)
>DO: Promotions should be easily dismissable and not distract from the experience.

### Failures
- The mobile search bar is not readily displayed on the homepage, but it can be found in the hamburger menu icon. Due to the lack of navigation on the top bar, users are force to select the hamburger menu to explore more options within the site.
- While viewing the site on a mobile device the overall look is very plain and flat, this is because of the use of a white background colour with text.

## 4. Content Design
### Successes
- The homepage layout displays only necessary content such as products, services and support. This encourages users to explore their site for more detailed information if they are invested.
- The use of ample white space allows images to be clear and vibrant which helps captures users attention.
- The site utilizes nested drop-down menus in order to help keep the site organized and tidy. With having less menu options displayed, user won't feel overwhelmed with information. They also hide their terms and conditions near the footer of the page.
- Content is displayed in grid format throughout the site. This helps sections content in the site, as well as helps format mobile browsing.
- The website layout is based on the same framework as other sites, making it familiar to users. It also incorporates universal icons (i.e. Magnifying glass icon for Search bar) to convey to users what the function of the button is.

### Failures
- Although the website shares the same framework and design as most websites, it makes it less unique or memorable for the user.

## Summary
Overall, [Telus.com](https://www.telus.com/en/) is a great website that is easy to navigate and visually appealing.
