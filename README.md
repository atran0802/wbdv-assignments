# Assignment 1: Website Review - Telus.com - Alex Tran
The website I chose to review is [Telus.com](https://www.telus.com/en/). My evaulation is based on 4 categories:

1. Usability and User Experience
2. Accessibility
3. Mobile Friendliness
4. Content Design

## 1. Usability and User Experience
### Successes

### Failures

- hover feature (icon enlarge or change colour)
- less text content (easy to scan page) includes read more button if users are interested
- navigation bar menu items have short and relevant names (easy for users to read)

- call to action button is large and grabs users attention "Get Started"

- hides terms and conditions
- has differnet language options
- Navigation top of page 
- 24/7 online technical support

- footer displays links to other areas of webpage

- use of card/grid to sections things on webpage

- search bar input field has auto complete
- website is layout based on the familiar (magniifying glass icon for search) 

- website features products and services that they provide and also offers support/help

## 2. Accessibility
### Successes
- accessibility test **92%** (1 image doesn't have alt attribute
- use of white background contrast with black text (branded colours)

### Failures

## 3. Mobile Friendliness
### Successes
- Mobile displays the exact same content as viewing from a web browser, with the exception of the navigation bar being replaced with the hamburger menu. This allows users who are familiar with the site to have the same web browsering experience on their phones. It also eliminate the time spent learning new features.
- Mobile prompts the download app feature on top of the display. Although it is in a location that is hard to reach with your thumbs, the text box is not that large to impair visibility and usability of the site.

### Failures
- mobile search bar is not readily displayed on homepage but can be found in the hamburger menu, due to the lack of navigation top bar users are force to select hamburger menu to explore more of the site
- looks plain and boring due to white colour background (nothing exciting/ very flat)

## 4. Content Design
### Successes
- Homepage displays only necessary content (products/service) to encoruage users to explore their site
- use of white space (images are clear and vibrante to catch the eye)
- nested drop-down menus help keep a clean screen
- mobile devices and minimize broswer window show hamburger icon for navigation

### Failures
