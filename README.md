# Assignment 1: Website Review - Telus.com - Alex Tran
The website I chose to review is [Telus.com](https://www.telus.com/en/). My evaulation is based on **4 categories**:

1. Usability and User Experience
2. Accessibility
3. Mobile Friendliness
4. Content Design

## 1. Usability and User Experience
### Successes
- There is less text content displayed, which makes the site easy to read and scan for key terms. The site includes *read more* buttons after text content if users are interested in learning more.
- The navigation bar menu items have short and relevant naming conventions, which allows user to easily read and identify when trying to navigate through the site. 
- Each call to action button is large and unique that it grabs the users attention. Some example are *"Get Started"* and *"View This Deal"*.
- The hover feature is unique as it either enlarges icons or changes colour for certain tabs/buttons on the site. This tells users where their cursor is on a site and makes them want to click on certain tabs/buttons.
- The site features differnet language options, such as English, Punjabi and Chinese. This is a great tool for user that read in a different language. Also there is a 24/7 online technical support service to assist users and clients.

### Failures

- use of card/grid to sections things on webpage

- search bar input field has auto complete

- website features products and services that they provide and also offers support/help

## 2. Accessibility
### Successes
- Lighthouse accessibility test scored **92%** for both desktop and mobile devices.
- The site displays majority of their content on a white background with purple, green and black (branded colours) text to contrast.

### Failures
- 1 image doesn't have a *alt attribute*.

## 3. Mobile Friendliness
### Successes
- Mobile displays the exact same content as viewing from a web browser, with the exception of the navigation bar being replaced with the hamburger menu. This allows users who are familiar with the site to have the same web browsering experience on their phones. It also eliminate the time spent learning new features.
- Mobile prompts the download app feature on top of the viewport. Although it is in a location that is difficult to reach within your thumb zone, the text box is not that large to impair visibility and usability of the site.

### Failures
- Mobile search field is not readily displayed on the homepage, but it can be found in the hamburger menu icon. Due to the lack of navigation on the top bar, users are force to select the hamburger menu to explore more within the site.
- While viewing the site on a mobile device the overall look is very plain and flat, this is because of the use of a white background colour with text.

## 4. Content Design
### Successes
- The homepage layout displays only necessary content such as products and services they provide. This encoruages users to explore their site for more detailed information if they are invested.
- The use of ample white space allows images to be clear and vibrant which helps captures users attention.
- The site utlizes nested drop-down menus in order to help keep a clean screen
- mobile devices and minimize broswer window show hamburger icon for navigation
- website is layout based on the familiar and uses universal icons (magniifying glass icon for search)
- hides terms and conditions
- footer displays links to other areas of webpage

### Failures
