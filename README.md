# Assignment 1: Website Review - Telus.com - Alex Tran
The website I chose to review is [Telus.com](https://www.telus.com/en/). My evaulation is based on 4 categories:

1. Usability and User Experience
2. Accessibility
3. Mobile Friendliness
4. Content Design

## 1. Usability and User Experience
### Successes
- less text content (easy to scan page) includes read more button if users are interested
- The navigation bar menu items have short and relevant naming conventions, which allows user to easily read and identify.
- The call to action button is large and grabs users attention "Get Started"
- hover feature (icon enlarge or change colour)

### Failures

- hides terms and conditions
- has differnet language options 
- 24/7 online technical support

- footer displays links to other areas of webpage

- use of card/grid to sections things on webpage

- search bar input field has auto complete

- website features products and services that they provide and also offers support/help

## 2. Accessibility
### Successes
- Lighthouse accessibility test scored **92%** for both desktop and mobile devices.
- The site displays majority of their content on a white background with purple, green and black (branded colours) text to contrast.

### Failures
- 1 image doesn't have a *alt attribute*.

## 3. Mobile Friendliness
### Successes
- Mobile displays the exact same content as viewing from a web browser, with the exception of the navigation bar being replaced with the hamburger menu. This allows users who are familiar with the site to have the same web browsering experience on their phones. It also eliminate the time spent learning new features.
- Mobile prompts the download app feature on top of the viewport. Although it is in a location that is difficult to reach within your thumb zone, the text box is not that large to impair visibility and usability of the site.

### Failures
- Mobile search field is not readily displayed on the homepage, but it can be found in the hamburger menu icon. Due to the lack of navigation on the top bar, users are force to select the hamburger menu to explore more within the site.
- While viewing the site on a mobile device the overall look is very plain and flat, this is because of the use of a white background colour with text.

## 4. Content Design
### Successes
- The homepage layout displays only necessary content such as products and services they provide. This encoruages users to explore their site for more detailed information if they are invested.
- The use of ample white space allows images to be clear and vibrant which helps captures users attention.
- The site utlizes nested drop-down menus in order to help keep a clean screen
- mobile devices and minimize broswer window show hamburger icon for navigation
- website is layout based on the familiar (magniifying glass icon for search)

### Failures
